### Django Software Foundation: Add Cross-DB JSONField

##### Abstract

> Django currently has limited support for `JSONField`. The support is provided
> in `contrib.postgres.fields` module, meaning it can only be used for
> PostgreSQL database backend. Django officially supports PostgreSQL, MySQL,
> SQLite, and Oracle Database Server backends. This project aims to add
> `JSONField` (and possibly `ArrayField`) that can be used for all database
> backends supported by Django.
